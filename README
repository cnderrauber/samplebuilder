This is a drop-in replacement for Pion's samplebuilder that is slightly
faster, slightly more correct, and has some additional features.  It will
hopefully be merged into Pion at some point.

Differences from Pion:

  * the `Pop` family of functions don't necessarily pop a packet if it is
    blocked by an earlier incomplete packet; this limits the amount of
    lost packets;

  * there is the ability to detect partition ends, see the
    `WithPartitionTailChecker` function;

  * the `ForcePopWithTimestamp` function can be used to flush any
    remaining packets.
