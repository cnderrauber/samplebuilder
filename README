This is a drop-in replacement for Pion's samplebuilder that is faster and
more correct.

Differences from Pion:

  * the `Pop` family of functions don't necessarily pop a packet if it is
    blocked by an earlier incomplete packet; this limits the amount of
    lost packets;

  * the `ForcePopWithTimestamp` function can be used to flush any
    remaining packets;

  * we're about 30% faster.
